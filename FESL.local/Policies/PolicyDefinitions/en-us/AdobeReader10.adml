	  <string id="Accessibility_Help">Acrobat provides many configurable preferences that help IT make the reading of PDFs more accessible for visually and motion-impaired users. These preferences control how PDFs appear on the screen and how they are read by a screen reader. Adobe provides these IT and user interface tools to government, educational institutions, and other customers who make servicing these users a top goal. Accessibility functionality falls into three distinct functional categories:

Viewing: Deliver a first class viewing Accessibility experience that all customers can rely on, including Assisted Technology Support.
Authoring: Adobe's PDF authoring capabilities enable creating first class, accessible PDFs.
Fixing and editing: Acrobat can fix or enhance un-accessible PDF files. This includes compliance support such as 508 Compliance.

For 10.x products, most preferences related to accessibility are available through the Accessibility Setup Assistant, which provides on-screen instructions for setting these preferences. Some preferences that affect accessibility are not available through the Accessibility Setup Assistant including preferences in the Reading, Forms, and Multimedia categories. 
The names shown for some preferences in the Accessibility Setup Assistant are different from the names for the same preferences shown in the Preferences dialog box. Acrobat Help uses the names shown in the Preferences dialog box. 
For more information about accessibility features, see www.adobe.com/accessibility.</string>

	  <string id="Tab_Order_Help">Assistive software determines how to present and interpret the content of the document by using the logical structure tree. Most assistive software depends on document structure tags to determine the appropriate reading order of text. Document structure tags let assistive software convey the meaning of images and other content in an alternate format, such as sound. An untagged document does not have structure information, and Acrobat must infer a structure based on the Reading Order preference setting. This situation often results in page items being read in the wrong order or not at all. 

This feature can improve navigation of form fields and links in properly authored (tagged) documents that don't specify a tab order. </string>

However, most of these preferences can be configured at the registry or plist level and used with Reader. For 10.x and later, Reader can also be configured from the UI as commenting is fully supported. 

There are three broad categories of annotations:
Markups: Editorial marks on the page such as underscores, circles, polygons, etc.

	  <string id="Adobe_Acrobat_Trust_List">Adobe Acrobat Trust List</string>
	  <string id="Adobe_Acrobat_Trust_List_Help">The Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL) program allows signers to create digital signatures that are trusted whenever the signed document is opened. Both Acrobat and Reader (since 9.0) are designed to download a list of "trusted" root digital certificates automatically. 9.x products download every every 90 days while 10.x products download every 30 days. Any digital signature created with a credential that chains to the high-assurance, trustworthy certificates on the AATL is trusted. 

The AATL program provides an easy way for the enterprise to easily set up trust, integrity-checking, and the green benefit from staying with an electronic document. After verifying that the applicant's services and credentials meet the assurance levels imposed by the AATL technical requirements, Adobe adds the certificate(s) to the Trust List itself, digitally signs the Trust List with an Adobe corporate digital ID that is linked to the Adobe Root certificate embedded in Adobe products, and then posts the list to a website hosted by Adobe. 

To assure that downloaded (as well as any other) trust anchors have not been revoked, configure bRevCheckTrust. 

For more about the AATL program, see http://www.adobe.com/security/approved-trust-list.html.</string>
	  <string id="Windows_Certificate_Integration">Windows Certificate Integration</string>
	  <string id="Windows_Certificate_Integration_Help">While Acrobat has its own store, the Windows store may already contain needed certificates or your enterprise may simply be a Windows shop. Windows integration allows end users to search for and use certificates in the Windows Certificate Store. 

End users can configure their application for Windows integration through the application's Preference panel. Configuration options allow users to search the Windows store from the Trusted Identity Manager (through the Search button), set trust levels for any found certificate, and choose which certificates to use for encryption (once the certificate is located and added to the Trusted Identity Manager). If a user has a personal ID in the Windows store, it appears in the Security Settings Console automatically without any special configuration. 

Administrators can control whether clients can access MSCAPI through Acrobat so that users can find, use, and set trust levels for Windows certificates. 

The following options are available:
Adding the Windows Certificate Store as a searchable repository with bCertStoreImportEnable.
Setting separate trust levels for approval and certification signatures.
Preventing end user modification of certificate trust levels.
Tuning the service provider interface for Revocation Checker Providers and Directory Providers (for Signature Validation).
For more information, refer to the Digital Signatures Guide and related documentation in the Content Security Library.</string>
	  <string id="Trusted_Identity_List_Configuration">Trusted Identity List Configuration</string>
	  <string id="Trusted_Identity_List_Configuration_Help">The trusted identity list contains all of a users imported certificates that they use for validating someone else's signature or encrypting a document for them. The list is maintained and managed via the Trusted Identity Manager; however, administrators can preconfigure applications to use non-default list files, add certificates from the Windows, store, and so on. 

The following options are available:
Creating a custom filename/file for the trusted identity list.
Specifying a non-default security handler to control Trusted Identity Manager functions. For details, see aAddressBook.
Adding the Windows Certificate Store as a searchable repository with bCertStoreImportEnable.
Turning off and on the ability to automatically download certificates sent by Adobe to users over the internet via bLoadSettingsFromURL.

Content security includes digital signatures, security methods such as password and certificate security, and other rights management features. 

Note the following:
Most of these settings are applicable to Windows, Macintosh, Unix, and Linux systems.
The examples use Acrobat; other applications may provide different menu options.
The security preferences folder does not appear in the registry until after the Acrobat product installation and a security feature is used. Subdirectories also appear as the code is exercised.

	  <string id="Security_Setting_Import">Security Setting Import</string>
	  <string id="Security_Setting_Import_Help">9.x products introduced a security feature that includes the ability to import and export security settings via an .acrobatsecuritysettings file, thereby enabling easier version upgrades as well as configuration of multiple machines. The security settings import/export features offers several advantages over FDF files:
Most document security and digital signature related settings can be encapsulated in an acrobatsecuritysettings file whereas FDF could only transport one setting type and a time and could not encapsulate registry settings at all.
One file can be used instead of many files.
Trust can be assigned to imported files on the fly, thereby simplifying workflows. Files can be signed and encrypted.
Updates can be configured to occur automatically on a specified schedule.
Use security settings files to backup and restore settings, to distribute settings in a workgroup or enterprise, and to send specific information to another user. Importing settings simply involves importing a file from a network (including automatically from a server) that has been exported from Acrobat and has then been made available from a trusted source. 

The following options are available: 

Specifying whether or not to poll a server for settings to import at regular intervals.
Configuring whether or not the user should grant permission prior to installing new settings.
Specifying a particular certificate so the signed settings will only be imported from a trusted source.

	  <string id="Custom_Security_Handlers">Custom Security Handlers</string>
	  <string id="Custom_Security_Handlers_Help">Adobe.PPKLite is the default security handler used for performing private key functions, validating signatures, and signing and encrypting documents. This is represented in the user interface as Adobe Default Security in the Digital Signatures Advanced Preferences dialog on both the Verification and Creation tabs. Administrators can install custom handlers to perform these functions, in which case the drop down lists on these tabs will list the additional handlers. All entries in the cHandler folder are reset by the Digital Signature Preferences dialog's Reset button.

Security handlers are Acrobat plugins. Information about creating plugins in general and security handlers in particular can be found in the Acrobat Software Development Kit (SDK) and its HFTs, header files, and other API documentation. Because Acrobat's Adobe.PPKLite is becoming more feature rich with each release, it is unlikely that you will need a custom security handler. 

If a custom handler is used, you can specify the following:
Separate handlers for signing/encryption and signature validation.
The default method displayed in the drop-down list of handlers.
Lock down the selections so they cannot be modified by end users.
For more information, refer to the Digital Signatures Guide and related documentation in the Content Security Library.</string>
	  <string id="Custom_Certificate_Preferences">Custom Certificate Preferences</string>
	  <string id="Custom_Certificate_Preferences_Help">The cCustomCertPrefs directory provides the means to use certificate-specific settings to modify application behavior when it encounters a particular certificate. As the application builds a certificate chain, it compares the information it finds in the certificate with that in the registry to see if there is a match. If there is a match, the custom settings are used to override the application's default behavior. Certificates that chain up to a CA that match those configured here or that contain recognized extensions will use the preferences set in this directory.

The default values are stored internally by the application and are not visible in the registry. An administrator can set the default behavior, but your configuration is subject to modification by end users via the user interface. 

The following features are available:
Specifying whether the default export behavior is to save or email the file.
Specifying whether the default export behavior is to sign the file.
Specifying whether the default certificate request behavior is to save or email the file.
Enabling or disabling WebBuy FDF processing (deprecated).

End users can turn this option on and off by using the Certificate Viewer's checkbox Show all certification paths found.</string>
	  <string id="Password_Caching">Password Caching</string>
	  <string id="Password_Caching_Help">By default, password caching is turned on so that users will not always have to enter a password when one is required. This feature affects Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Server log in, signing with digital IDs in the Acrobat store (pfx or p12 files), changing password timeout policies, and creating new password security policies. For example, setting the option to false disables the menu option Save password with the policywhen creating a new policy. 

The following options are available:
Controlling whether some passwords are cached to disk.
Disabling the option to save a password with a policy.
(Bug: Not working for 9.0) Disabling the Never ask for password option on a digital IDs password timeout dialog.
Streamlining Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Server workflows. This key does not exist in HKCU. It can only be used in HKLM.

	  <string id="Digital_ID_Defaults">Digital ID Defaults</string>
	  <string id="Digital_ID_Defaults_Help">Most digital ID default values are set by the application when a user first uses an ID or manually specifies a default value in the Security Settings Console. Moreover, since user actions will overwrite some preconfigured value an administrator might provide, setting many of these properties is usually not worthwhile. However, it is possible and the following options are available:
Specifying a default URL to obtain a new digital ID. This value is NOT overwritten by user actions.
Listing a set of attribute certificates.
Specifying a default signing ID. This value is end user-specific.
Specifying a default encryption ID. This value is end user-specific.
Customizing a default directory server used to locate certificates that can be imported into the Trusted Identity Manager.
Note: Acrobat 9.0 users who configure a 3rd party security handler plugin may find that their non-default choice does not stick if the plugin calls PSUNregisterHandler(). That is, each time Acrobat restarts, the non-default security handler choice is lost. To fix the problem, change the plugin code to not call PSUNregisterHandler().</string>

The form XObject provides a proxy for the page in the target file, and Acrobat can display or print the proxy as well as the referenced page from the target file in place of the proxy. 

On Windows, this feature interacts with the Trust Manager (TM). In fact, settings configured through the user interface work in tandem with TM settings and will not take effect unless privileged locations are defined for the parent document referencing the XObject.

Doing so only affects the production and not the consumption of PDF files, and it only affects encryption and digital signature workflows. 

v. 9.x and earlier: Crypto-C ME 2.1 encryption module with FIPS 140-2 validation certificate 608.
v. 10: Crypto-C ME 3.0.0.1 encryption module with FIPS 140-2 validation certificate 1092
FIPS mode changes Acrobat's default behavior as follows:
FIPS-compliant algorithms are always used.
Self-signed certificate creation is disabled. In FIPS mode, users cannot create self-signed certificates.
Signing with non-FIPS supported algorithms results in an error message; that is, signing fails if the document hash algorithm (digest method) is set to MD5 or RIPEMD160.
Password security is turned off. Users can apply certificate or Adobe LifeCycle Rights Management Server security using the AES encryption algorithm to a document, but password encryption is disabled.
When applying certificate security, the RC4 encryption algorithm is not allowed.
Documents protected with non-FIPS compliant algorithms cannot be saved.</string>
	  <string id="Toolbar_Customization">Toolbar Customization</string>
	  <string id="Toolbar_Customization_Help">In both Acrobat and Reader, users have the capability to customize and favorite toolbars via the user interface by choosing View > Show/Hide > Toolbar Items and then selecting particular toolbar items to display. Acrobat users have an additional menu item called Quick Tools. This feature displays a two panel dialog that allows users to add any button or button category. 

For example, you can expand the button tree under Forms to add the Create New Form button, or you could choose to add the top level Forms item to add all the forms buttons to the top menu. All user choices are stored with the application preferences and are essentially a "favorited" item. 

Pre deployment configuration in enterprise settings involves the following:
Configuring the application via the user interface.
Closing the application.
Opening the registry or plist directory and going to AVGeneral\(feature name).
Copying the desired settings from the registry or plist. Settings can be deployed via the Customization Wizard, GPO, and any preferred scripted mechanism as desired.
The methodology above provides a certain way to identify the requisite buttons and non-conflicting atom values. If you create these preferences manually, make sure the index number is unique and that the correct button names are used.

It is possible to require certain features for certificates used to sign OCSP requests and responses. If either does not meet the specified parameters, it is considered invalid and the signature status may be Unknown or Invalid. See RFC 2560 for details. 

Prior to 10.1, OCSP responses without nextUpdate were never embedded in a signature. For 10.1 and later, OCSP responses are always embedded irrespective of the presence of nextUpdate; however, whether they are used for signature validation depends on certain conditions:
Validation time is greater than thisUpdate minus the value of iMaxClockSkew (the default is 5 minutes). This test is always performed.
When nextUpdate is present and the validation time is less than the nextUpdate time plus the value of iMaxClockSkew.
When nextUpdate is not present and the validation time is less than the thisUpdate time or the producedAt time (whichever is greater) plus the value of iMaxClockSkew.
If you need a relaxed security environment (for example, when the responder is caching OCSP responses), bIgnoreNextUpdate can be set to 1 to ignore the last test. In this case, embedded responses without nextUpdate are always used for signature validation provided that they pass first test. 

This behavior is designed to support the long term validation feature and allows validating a signature with embedded responses that were valid at signing time. The following options are available:
Specifying when to do revocation checking as well as the effect of a failed or bad response.
Specifying when and where to go online to get a response.

Storing such data in a signature enables offline revocation checking and a determination of whether the signing certificate was valid at the time of signing. 

Setting bIsEnabled to 1 via the GUI or registry automatically sets cSign\iReqRevCheck to 2. The rationale is that if you choose to embed the revocation status you probably want a status to embed. A consequence of this choice is that you must do a check and retrieve a good result; otherwise, no signature is created. In other words, signing with a revoked certificate is prevented when this setting is on.

	  <string id="Requiring_Pre-signing_Digest_Comparison_Help">When signing a PDF document, a message digest is created for the document and sent to the cryptographic module that performs the signing operation. Setting the registry entry bEnforceSecureChannel to 1 ensures the message digest sent to the cryptographic module is checked against the signed message digest that it returns. This flag ensures that intermediate layers of software between Acrobat and the cryptographic module do not tamper with the signing operation. 

The following rules apply:
When using a certificate that includes a DSA public key with omitted parameters, the test to detect signature validity is not performed. In these cases, setting bEnforceSecureChannel has no effect.
When this preference is turned on, a digest mismatch results in a warning dialog. The signature is removed from the document and the signing application aborts the signing process.</string>

Administrators can also set these preferences from the registry. Enhanced security preferences are stored with the Trust Manager preferences. Where the effect of these settings overlap, granted permissions always take precedence.
Note: For 9.2 and earlier, this feature overrides enhanced security settings for files and folders. With 9.3, enhanced security settings take precedence. For example, with enhanced security enabled, files and folders can be trusted as privileged locations and access will be granted even if Trust Manager is set to "Block all." Also, an cross domain access always requires specifically trusting those domains as a privileged location in the Enhanced Security panel--simply trusting those sites in the Trust Manager will not work.</string>

	  <string id="Specifying_Privileged_Locations">Specifying Privileged Locations</string>
	  <string id="Specifying_Privileged_Locations_Help">Privileged locations are designed to let users and administrators specify trusted content that should be exempt from enhanced security retrictions. A location may be a file, folder, or host identified by a unique ID in the registry. The privileged location ID is stored as a string with a value containing the path to the trusted content within one or more of the possible keys. Each key defines one behavior which the content is allowed to exercise. For example, if a privileged location ID and value resides under the cCrossDomain and cSilentPrinting keys, then both cross domain access and silent printing are permitted. 

You can specify trusted locations by creating a new key under the cab key associated with the feature you want to allow. Available cabs include cCrossdomain, cDataInjection, cExternalStream, cScriptInjection, cSilentPrint, cWeblink, cJavaScript, cUnsafeJavaScript, cJavaScriptURL. 

Note the following:
TrustManager\cTrustedFolders contains cabs for trusted folders AND files.
TrustManager\cTrustedSites contains cabs for trusted hosts such as http(s).
It's possible to manually add other cabs to assign trust. See JSPrefs.
Each t(ID) must be unique. In the example below, t3 could reside in each of the cabs, but there could not be more than one t3 in each cab.
Registry Configuration: Cross domain file trust
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\Acrobat Reader\9.0\TrustManager\cTrustedFolders\cCrossdomain]
"t3"="C:\\Documents and Settings\\brogers\\My Documents\\acrobat_logo16.png"
The feature behaves as follows:

All enhanced security keys are stored under Trust Manager. The Trust Manager hive does not appear in the registry until the user interface is exercised. However, you can create it manually.
A privileged location may be a file, folder, or host.
Privileged locations can be permanently disabled or enabled by the administrator.
Configuration may occur via the user interface or directly in the registry.
If configured through the user interface, the privileged location ID only appears under a subset of the possible keys. Functionality may change across releases, so test the UI and see what trust is assigned.
Administrator's can lock down the feature in HKLM so that users cannot change the setting.
Permissions granted by other features often overlap. For example, cross domain policies, internet access settings in Trust Manager, and certificate trust settings for certified documents sometimes interact so that the most permissive setting takes precedence. Users should TEST THEIR CONFIGURATION prior to deployment.
All key (tID) names should be unique.
10.x products support the use of wildcard matching of subdomain components for trusted host URLs. For example, for a basic URL of a.b.c.adobe.com, you can wildcard on all of a, b, or c. It is required that at least the first subdomain is specified (adobe in this case). So *.corp.adobe.com or lcforms.*.adobe.com works, but *forms.corp.adobe.com or lcforms.corp.*.com will not.
